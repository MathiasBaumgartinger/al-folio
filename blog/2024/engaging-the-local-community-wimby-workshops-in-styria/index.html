<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>In the picturesque region of Styria, Austria, WIMBY recently hosted a set of workshops aimed at fostering local engagement and understanding around wind energy projects. This initiative was part of WIMBY’s broader efforts to explore the social acceptance of wind turbines, while addressing the concerns and perspectives of residents and stakeholders.Styria, known for its unique landscapes, is also one of the three pilot cases at the heart of the project. The workshops were held in the towns of Thannegg and Irdning, where residents and stakeholders were invited to participate in interactive sessions designed to capture a wide range of opinions about wind energy installations.These workshops were strategically designed not only to educate but also to participate. WIMBY’s goal was to create a series of tools for open discussions about the benefits and challenges of wind turbines, while encouraging local input into the decision-making process.The workshops featured a variety of engaging activities to encourage both learning and dialogue. Researchers and facilitators from the WIMBY team led different interactive exercises. One of the highlights was the 3D mapping session hosted by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), where participants worked together to envision wind energy installations in their region. Additionally, The Kelso Institute Europe facilitated a stakeholder mapping session, helping attendees identify key groups and individuals whose perspectives would be crucial for the success of any wind energy project in the region. And Utrecht University conducted a mental modeling session where participants could visualise and express their thoughts about the potential impact of wind turbines on their community.The workshops were designed to foster trust and ensure that community members felt their voices were heard. By involving local residents and stakeholders in hands-on activities, WIMBY was able to better understand their concerns and ideas, while also providing valuable insights into how the wind energy project could be tailored to locals’ specific needs.As the local community is integral to the success of sustainable energy projects, WIMBY focused on addressing concerns such as the visual impact of wind turbines, their potential effect on wildlife, and how the development of such projects could benefit the region economically and socially.The feedback collected from these sessions will be analysed and integrated into future project planning, ensuring that wind energy development remains transparent, inclusive, and aligned with local needs. By engaging with the community in such an open and interactive manner, WIMBY hopes to pave the way for more successful and accepted wind energy projects not just in Styria, but across Europe.Stay tuned for more updates on our future workshops: next ones will be held in Portugal at the beginning of 2025! Follow WIMBY on Twitter and LinkedInDon’t forget to subscribe to our newsletter 👇SubscribeStarting today, WIMBY will begin its interactive workshops in Portugal, marking another step in our…WIMBY workshops ready to kick off in PortugalBrian Ohrbeck Hansen from DTU presented a project poster at the Wind Europe conference in…WIMBY poster at WindEurope 2024At the 2025 Wind Energy Science Conference (WESC) in Nantes, the WIMBY project team organised…WIMBY at WESC 2025: a focus on wind power integration and societal impactsIn November 2023, the revised EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) entered into force, increasing…1 KM, 3 KM or beyond?
